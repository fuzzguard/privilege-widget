== Description ==
This plugin allows you to display widget items based on if a user is logged in, logged out or based on the role you have given the user.

This plugin allows fine-grained permissions to be added to each individual widget item to display or not display the item based on the
 users logged in/logged out status or the role assigned to the user.  This solves the problem of having to modify theme functions.php files to add in widget restrictions.  The changes in functions.php is often overwritten by a theme update.  This plugin removes that worry, as you can update the theme, independent of the plugin.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `plugin` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' area in WordPress
1. Go to Appearance > Widgets
1. Add a widget to a sidebar.
1. Edit the widget accordingly.  First select whether you'd like to display the item to Logged out Users, Logged in Users (Selectable Roles), or All Users.
1. Save the changes to each individual widget.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I cannot see the options for Privilege Widget under widgets in the Admin Panel? =

You need to add the widget to a sidebar before you can change the display status on the widget.

= As a developer what hooks are there for this plugin? =
There are two hooks that have been provided for this plugin.  The first hook is: 'priv_widget_roles'. It can be used to allow other plugins to add roles to be checked by 'Privilege Widget':
    add_filter( 'priv_widget_roles', 'roles_to_add', 10, 1 );
	
    function roles_to_add($roles /* WP_RoleNames Array */) {
		$roles['new_role'] = 'New Role';
		return $roles;
    }
	
The second hook is: 'priv_widget_visibility'.  It can be used for other plugins to filter the result for the front-end display of the widget items generated by 'Privilege Widget':
    add_filter( 'priv_widget_visibility', 'filter_FE_display', 10, 2);

    function filter_FE_display($visibility /* Boolean */, $item /* WP_POST Object*/) {
		if ($item->ID == '470' || $item->title == 'Logout') {
				$visibility = true;
		}
		return $visibility;
    }
